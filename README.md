## Background

I made this application not only because I had to make a webscraping project, but also because this is something I can actually modify further and use in the future.

## Install

It might not work if you try to run this locally on your computer (non online IDE) due to me specifically making it capable of running on repl.it

## Usage

Copy and paste a steam link to any **game**, and type in the price you want the game at.
Then type in your email correctly, and you will be notified when that game drops to or below the requested price
